# Dummy Content for Hugo

Here's 100 files filled with Lorem Ipsum to use while you develop your templates.

You probably don't want to use them all: on my M1 Macbook Pro with 32G memory, `hugo server` begins to bork if I use any more than 30

## Need more?
If you do need them all and even more, just use the included script to generate even more Lipsum for Hugo.
